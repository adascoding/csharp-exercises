# Task Description

Create a **C# program** that generates a **random matrix** (a grid of numbers) with dimensions between **1 and 8 rows and columns**. Each element in the matrix should be a **random number** within a specific range for each row. The program should then **print the matrix** in a readable format and **calculate** how many numbers are **even** and how many are **odd**, displaying the results along with the **percentage** of even and odd numbers in the matrix.
